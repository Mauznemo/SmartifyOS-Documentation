# Updating project

## How to update
To update your Unity project you can click `SmartifyOS > Check for Update` and then click on `Check for Update`.
If there is an update it will show you a changelog and which files will change. Then you can just click on `Sync Repository`.

## How to upgrade Unity version
You can't use the update tool to update the Unity version since Unity has to be closed to do so.
1. Close the Unity Editor and Unity Hub
2. Open your Terminal in the `SmartifyOS` directory and run `git fetch` and `git pull` (see: [Errors while updating](#errors-while-updating) if you get any errors)
3. Open up the Unity Hub again
4. Click on the ⚠️ icon of the project and install the needed Unity Editor version (make sure to tick `Linux Build support (Mono)` under `Add modules`)

## How file changes are handled
Files modified by you will never be overwritten!

## Errors while updating
If you modified one of the files and it was also modified on the remote you will get an error while trying to update.

### Error saying to commit or to stash changes
If you get an error like this you first need to [commit](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_commit) your local changes.
If you want an relatively easy to use GUI tool to do this you can use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Merge conflict
If you run the updater (or `git pull`) again after committing you may get an Merge conflict in the files that you changed an which where also changed on the remote.

To fix this open the project in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Under the `Source control` tab you will see these files (they should have a ❗ icon). You then can click on them and on the button `Resolve in Merge Editor` and fix the conflict.

Here is a tutorial for the Merge Editor (explanation of editor starts at `02:18`)
