# Creating  windows

## Creating a window
1. Right click somewhere in the hierarchy and click on `UI > SmartifyOS > Window`
2. Give the window a title
3. With the `fullscreen` toggle you can choose if it should be a fullscreen window or not. If not you change the size of the window.
4. If you don't already have a script for the window leave the toggle `Create Script` on and click on `Browse`, then you can select where the file should be saved (you can leave it as it is if you don't want to use another directory stricture)
5. Then just click `Create` and the window will be created (and the script added if it was toggled on)

## Managing existing Windows/Apps
To manage existing Windows and their scripts in your scene you can open the setting (`Ctrl + .` or `SmartifyOS > Settings`).
Then you can click on the tab `Apps`. There you can show and select the existing Windows in your scene and also remove them together with their script files.
